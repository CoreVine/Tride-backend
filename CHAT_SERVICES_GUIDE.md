# Chat Services Integration Guide for Flutter Developers

This guide provides essential information about chat service endpoints and socket connections. Developers are expected to implement the Flutter code based on these specifications.

## üîê Prerequisites & Authentication Flow

### Required for All Users
- ‚úÖ Valid JWT token from authentication
- ‚úÖ User's email verified (`is_verified: true`)
- ‚úÖ Documents approved (parents/drivers)
- ‚úÖ **Device token registered** (required for notifications)

### Authentication & Device Token Registration

**Step 1: Login with Device Token**
```
POST /api/auth/login
```

**Required Body**:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "account_type": "parent|driver|admin",
  "device_token": "flutter_device_token_here"
}
```

**Important**: Device token is required for non-admin accounts and is automatically stored for push notifications.

**Step 2: Logout (Clean Device Token)**
```
POST /api/auth/logout
```

**Required Body**:
```json
{
  "device_token": "flutter_device_token_here"
}
```

**Testing Requirement**: Must login with device token before testing notifications.

## üì° Step 1: Socket.IO Connection

### Connection URL
```
ws://your-server-url
```

### Authentication
```javascript
{
  'auth': {
    'token': 'Bearer your_jwt_token_here'
  },
  'extraHeaders': {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_jwt_token_here'
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Implementation Flow

1. **Login with Device Token** ‚Üí Required for notifications
2. **Connect Socket** ‚Üí Authenticate with JWT
3. **Get Chat Room** ‚Üí HTTP request to get/create room
4. **Join Room** ‚Üí Socket emit to receive real-time messages
5. **Load History** ‚Üí HTTP request for past messages
6. **Send Messages** ‚Üí HTTP request + automatic socket broadcast
7. **Handle Real-time** ‚Üí Listen to socket events for updates
8. **Leave Room** ‚Üí Socket emit when exiting chat

### Admin Flow
1. **Login as Admin** ‚Üí No device token required
2. **Check Permissions** ‚Üí Verify role and permissions
3. **Access Admin Endpoints** ‚Üí View/manage chats
4. **Merge Groups** ‚Üí (Super Admin only) Combine ride groups

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Device Token Required**: Must register device token during login for notifications
2. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints need valid JWT token
3. **Socket Connection**: Required for real-time features
4. **Room Joining**: Must join via socket before receiving messages
5. **Admin Permissions**: Different endpoints require specific permissions
6. **Group Merging**: Required for multi-parent groups (Super Admin only)
7. **Real-time Updates**: All actions broadcast to connected users
8. **Error Handling**: Check response status codes
9. **Testing Order**: Login ‚Üí Register device token ‚Üí Test notifications

## üêõ Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Check JWT token validity and user verification |
| 403 Forbidden | Verify document approval and admin permissions |
| Socket connection fails | Check token format in auth header |
| Messages not received | Ensure room is joined via socket |
| Notifications not working | Ensure device token was registered during login |
| Admin endpoints blocked | Check role and specific permissions |
| Group merge fails | Ensure Super Admin role |

---

## üìö Testing Requirements

### Pre-Testing Setup
1. **Complete Authentication Flow**:
   - Register account ‚Üí Verify email ‚Üí Login with device token
   - For admin: Login as admin (no device token needed)

2. **Document Approval**:
   - Parents: Ensure `documents_approved: true`
   - Drivers: Ensure driver papers approved

3. **Group Membership**:
   - Ensure user is member of ride group for chat access
   - For group merging: Have multiple groups ready

### Testing Order
1. Login endpoints (with device token)
2. Socket connection
3. Chat room creation/access
4. Message sending/receiving
5. Notification testing (requires device token)
6. Admin features (with proper permissions)
7. Group merging (Super Admin only)

### Use Postman Collections
Use the provided Postman collections in the backend root directory to test all endpoints before implementing in Flutter. Collections include proper authentication flow and permission testing.
